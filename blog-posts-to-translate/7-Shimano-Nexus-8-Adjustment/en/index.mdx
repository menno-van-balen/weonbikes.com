## Why is the Schimano Nexus 8 so popular?

## Step 1

The gear shifter needs to be in the 4th gear.

👉 Start by switching into the 1st gear and then switch up gear by gear to the 4th.

If you end up in gear 5 by accident, switch back to 1 and switch up slower.

## Step 2

👉 Find the 2 yellow marks on the gear hub.

They are difficult to see due to oil and dirt. Use a clean rag to clean the gear hub next to the chain.

## Step 3

👉 Align the 2 yellow marks by turning the knob on the gear cable.

In the following picture you'll see the knob on the gear cable that you need to turn.

This is how the marks look, when they are not aligned yet. You need to turn further.

This is how the marks are supposed to look like when properly aligned.
