## For Cycle Touring Beginners: Bike-Friendly and Signposted

In terms of landscape, Sweden is varied, bike-friendly and less complicated than Norway. In the north there is a lot of forest and mountains over 2,000 m high. Further south it becomes more and more flat.

The long-distance bike route _Sverigeleden_ runs from north to south through the country. The main route is 2620 km long but has numerous additional branches. The cycle routes are marked on the Open Cycle Map and are also signposted: long-distance cycle routes are green, regional routes are blue and local routes are black.

## Bicycle in Public Transport

The railway in Sweden is called the SJ and most of the trains **do not** take bicycles. But there are exceptions: the [Inlandsbanan](https://inlandsbanan.se/) from Mora to Gällivare, Flixtrain between Stockholm and Gothenburg, [X-trafik](http://xtrafik.se/) in the Gävleborg region and [Norrtåg](https://www.norrtag.se/) on the Sundsvall–Storlien and Sundsvall–Umeå routes. You can take your bicycles along the national cycle routes (see below) if there is space, for example with the regional trains [Öresundstågen](https://www.oresundstag.se/en/) and [Krösatågen](http://www.krosatagen.se/).

**Flixbus** is well connected in Sweden and takes conventional bicycles. 5 bikes at the back of the bus, then you don't need to disassemble anything, and 3 folding bikes in the bus, transport bags are provided. You have to book the bike when you buy the ticket. The ticket for the bike costs only 9 euros (2022). From Germany there are a number of inexpensive connections to Sweden: From Hamburg, Berlin and Rostock you can get to Helsingborg, Gothenburg and Stockholm, among others. From there you could go even further north. Flixbus even offers a direct connection from Bucharest to Stockholm, straight through Europe - exciting, isn't it?

Here you'll find more about [bicycle transport with Flixbus](https://www.flixbus.com/service/bike-travel?_sp=ea5ab11e-c186-45c1-9a9c-b47fd6e2327c.1656572704170&atb_pdid=ebba282a-53af-47da-88f4-a5f43ff2b731&_ga=2.28116926.388467287.1656572698-2059690020.1656425416).

**Renting a bike** is no problem in Sweden. However, this will affect your vacation budget.

## Where to Sleep in Sweden

The right to roam applies in Sweden. In other words, you can wild camp for one night within reasonable distance of private land. In case of doubt, just ask. It is usually not a problem to pitch your tent for one night.

![Old Summer Pasture](../img/SommerweideSchweden.jpg)

_Vandrarhem_ means youth hostel. They are comparatively cheap. Private accommodation, on the other hand, tends to be more expensive. They are called _Stuga_, _Rum_, _Gästboende_ or _Gästis_.

In Sweden you pay in Swedish kroner (SEK) and mostly cash-free. Don't forget your credit card!

## EuroVelo Routes in Sweden

Several EuroVelo Routes run through Sweden:

### Sun Route EuroVelo 7, ca. 3000 km

The [Sun Route from the North Cape to Malta](https://weonbikes.com/en/blog/7-cycling-routes-europe-north-to-south/#3-sun-route-7700-km-eurovelo-7) leads from north to south partially along the Baltic Sea through Sweden. You leave Sweden via Gothenburg towards Copenhagen in Denmark.

The northernmost section of the [European Divide Trail from Norway to Portugal](https://weonbikes.com/en/blog/7-cycling-routes-europe-north-to-south/#2-european-divide-trail-7700-km) runs north-south through Sweden, but a little further west than EuroVelo 7. This route avoids roads and follows gravel paths or **trails** wherever possible.

## Sweden's 3 National Cycle Routes, 900 km

There are three national cycle routes in Sweden:

1.  Kattegattleden
2.  Sydostleden
3.  Sydkustleden

Together they form a 900 km long-distance cycle path along the south coast. Although the route is very well developed, there is no information about charging stations for e-bikes along the route, so you have to ask at restaurants and accommodation. However, the infrastructure is fully developed and opportunities are everywhere. Wild camping is also permitted here, however, in nature reserves only in designated areas.

If you can't bring your own bike, you can also find bike rentals for touring bikes for this route: [Travelshop](https://travelshop.se/en/hyrcyklar/) in Malmö and Helsingborg and [EverTrek](https://www.evertrek.eu/rental-bikes/) in Gothenburg, for example.

### Kattegattleden Gothenburg-Helsingborg, 390 km

The Kattegat Cycle Route is signposted in both directions, mostly car-free and paved. There is a detailed [website in English about Kattegattleden](https://www.kattegattleden.se/en) with maps and info material.

Kattegattleden is located in the Skåne region and passes the following places: Gothenburg - Kungsbacka - Varberg - Falkenberg - Halmstad - Laholm - Båstad - Ängelholm - Höganäs - Helsingborg

This route is absolutely poetic: sea, beaches, everything is green even in summer. You often come through small towns and picturesque ports, you can go sightseeing and enjoy delicious food. Halmstadt is known as a summer town with many events.

![West Coast Sweden](../img/Sweden-westcoast.jpg)

### Sydostleden Växjö-Simrishamn, 270 km

Fishing villages, gardens and apple orchards, art studios, farm shops and traditional inns invite you to take a relaxing tour on this eastern section of the three national bike routes. Sydostleden has been Sweden's second national cycle route since 2016. From north to south you come to the coast through the following cities: Växjö - Tingsryd - Fridafors - Karlshamn - Sölvesborg - Kristianstad - Brösarp - Simrishamn.

In Kristianstad you'll find the county's lowest point: 2.41 m below sea level. Sweden's most famous apple juice is pressed in Kiviks Musteri. Of course, this goes hand in hand with delicious apple pie in rustic cafés and in September the apple market transforms the small town into a cheerful folk festival. Here you can find the [Southeast Cycle Path website](https://sydostleden-sydkustleden.se/en/delled/sydostleden).

### Sydkystleden Simrishamn-Helsingborg, 260 km

The South Coast Cycle Route has been around since 2019. It bridges the gap between Kattegattleden on the west coast and Sydostleden on the east coast. You come through the places Simrishamn - Ystad - Trelleborg - Skanör - Malmö - Landskrona - Helsingborg.

![Ale stones at Kåseberga](../img/Ale-Steine.jpg)

<figcaption>Ale stones at Kåseberga 10 km southeast of Ystad</figcaption>

Ystad is Wallander's territory. Henning Mankell's famous police inspector solved his trickiest cases here. In Kåseberga there is one of the largest preserved ship settings. Smygehuk is Sweden's southernmost point and in Trelleborg there is a Viking fortress to visit. You can relax on white beaches in Skanör and get immersed in urban life in Malmö.

So the infrastructure is comfortable. Newly created cycle paths, low-traffic roads and gravel paths make up the Väner Cycle Route.

The landscape is dominated by the lake, however, the tour is absolutely varied. You ride through forest, along skerries and farmland, you can relax on the beach, go sightseeing in the neighboring towns or try culinary delights in cafes and restaurants.

![Lake in evening light](../img/Lake-evening.jpg)

The route: Karlstad - Mariestad - Vänersborg - Åmål - Karlstad. The historical centers of Mariestad, Lidköping, Kristinehamn and Åmål are worth a visit.

## Gotland Route, 500 km

The island of Gotland is the largest island in the Baltic Sea and has been inhabited since time immemorial. The island is a popular holiday destination and in summer there is quite a lot of traffic on the roads. You can ride a bike anywhere. Don't stick too much to the route, rather look for smaller paths on your digital map and avoid busy roads. Some of the signage may be missing.

**Ferry connections** are available from **Nynäshamn** south of Stockholm, **Oskarshamn** in Småland and from **Rostock** in Germany, to the harbor of Visby on Gotland.

What to see once you make it to the island? White beaches, flower meadows, the old seasonal Gotland fishing villages, medieval country churches, bizarre **Rauks** - the peculiar limestone pillars, Viking art and Visby. During the 32nd week of every year, the medieval town hosts a festival: the Medieval Week. It's insanely popular. Decide for yourself whether you like the hustle and bustle or prefer to cycle around Gotland in the off-season.

![Rauks](../img/Rauks-Gotland.jpg)

## Öland Route

On the island of Öland there are several routes that are easy to follow by bike without a special map. You'll see them on the Open Cycle Map. From the mainland, the Sverigeleden leads there, namely route 34A from Vrankunge via Kalmar to Bryxelkrok in northern Öland, 279 km.

**Get on your bike and share the most beautiful, safest, shortest, or longest and most practical bike routes with others. Talk about holidays by bicycle. Give someone a bike or a bike day! Just don't give up until everyone's riding by bicycle. Because cycling makes you happy.**
