**Welcome to our new website weonbikes.com. Here we will regularly write about our life by bicycle. We are glad that you've found us.**

## Which articles about bicycle touring can you read here soon

In the next post we will look at cycling routes that run through Europe from north to south. Because that will be our next big bike touring adventure: from the North Cape in Norway to Cabo de SÃ£o Vincente in Portugal. From Cape to Cape through Europe.

There is a variety of routes: European Divide trail, Atlantic coast route or one along the Russian border and through Poland towards Italy - so many possibilities. How are you supposed to decide? Which apps are the best for planning and saving routes? Where can you find travel guides or travel reports from other bikepackers?

Once the route is roughly decided, the following posts go into the details: road or trail? Touring or bikepacking? What kind of bicycle goes with which route?

Until we start in 2023, of course, we don't just want to plan, we also want to go on cycling trips and stay up to date on what's happening in the cycling world.

## Which bicycle events take place live again in 2022

Several events will presumably return as in-presence events this year:

- [World Bicycle Day](https://www.un.org/en/observances/bicycle-day), June 3rd, anywhere where people ride their bikes
- [Eurobike](https://www.eurobike.com/en/), this time in Frankfurt, Germany, the largest international bicycle fair in Europe, July 13th to 17th
- [Velocity2022](https://www.velo-city2022.com/en/) in Ljubljana, Slovenia, June 14th to 17th, World Cycling Summit, that took place in [Lissabon](https://www.velo-city2021.com/) in 2021
- [VeloBerlin](https://velofestivals.com/veloberlin/), April 9th to 10th in Berlin, bicycle festival all about bikes, VeloHamburg, May 21st/22nd and VeloFrankfurt June 11th/12th in Germany
- [BAM](https://www.bameurope.it/en/), Bicycle Adventure Meeting, June 10th to 12th in Mantova, Italy, meeting for bicycle travelers

By now still not in-presence:

- [International Cargo Bike Festival](https://cargobikefestival.com/), was planned for May 6th to 8th, but will apparently not take place, the CargoBike Magazine 2022 should appear in October
- [Fiets- en Wandelbeurs](https://www.fietsenwandelbeurs.nl/fietsroute-van-het-jaar/), last time 2020 in Utrecht, Netherlands, could not take place yet this year, but is planned to be back in 2023. However, 4 [Cycle routes of the year](https://www.fietsenwandelbeurs.nl/fietsroute-van-het-jaar/) has been nominated, including the 925 km long [Flanders route](https://www.vlaanderenmetdefiets.be/en/routes/vlaanderen.html).
- Anyone interested in urban mobility will find even more suggestions at the [ECF](https://ecf.com/news-and-events/calendar?page=1).

## What kind of bicycle events can you visit on a regular base

[Critical Mass](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_Mass_(cycling)>)

Under the Critical Mass banner bicycle meetings are held **regularly** in various cities. In [Lisbon](http://www.massacriticapt.net/), for example, always on the last Friday of the month. Here you will find [your city](https://criticalmass.in/world). In Germany, Critical Mass for children - ["Kidicalmass"](https://kinderaufsrad.org/kidical-mass-2021-in-bildern/) was a great success last year and is therefore planned to take place again in 2022: on May 14th/15th and on September 24th/25th at [various locations](https://kinderaufsrad.org/aktionsbuendnis/#aktionsorte).

## What are our plans with our website weonbikes.com

About our last cycling tour [from Moscow to the North Cape by bicycle](https://weonbikes.com/en/book) we made a book, which is available at [BoD](https://www.bod.de/buchshop/catalogsearch/result/?q=Uta+Schulz) in German and English and is also on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Uta-Schulz/e/B09SVCVM7H?ref=sr_ntt_srch_lnk_1&qid=1646048903&sr=1-1).

By World Bicycle Day on June 3rd, 2022, we'll publish the book in Dutch and Portugues. We also want our website to be in **four languages**. We live in Portugal. German and Dutch are our native languages and we speak English with everyone who doesn't have these languages in common with us. A challenge that we accepted, because our multilingual life is part of our identity, because we don't want to decide for one language only and because we want to be understood by all our friends.
