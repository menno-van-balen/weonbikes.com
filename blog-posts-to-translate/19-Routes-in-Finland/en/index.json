  "2-paragraph": "Solitude, endless forests, 1000 lakes. Cycling in Finland is not difficult. The country is flat throughout. Ancient trade routes run through the land: the Via Karelia and the King's Road, for example. Those looking for solitude are in the right place in the east and north of Finland. The roads are good and the sporadic traffic hardly bothers you as you roll through the idyllic forest and lake landscape. More likely, startled reindeer will run ahead of you. They know cars, however, they are afraid of cyclists. In the south and west, on the other hand, you can get to know the country and its people: the capital Helsinki, Turku in the skerries, the industrial city of Tampere or Oulo in the north.",

You can copy the name from the map and then search for the hut on the <g-3>national park website</g> The huts are also marked on the Open Street Map.

For your bike tour, you should bring mosquito-proof clothing for the evening and a hat with a mosquito net. Repellents didn't work for us at all.

Helsinki is a great starting point for the King's Road, the Coastal Route (part of the Baltic Coast Cycle Route) or the <g-9>National Park Route</g>. An alternative is Flixbus to <g-11>Stockholm</g>.

  "56-heading": "Via Karelia 1080 km",
  "57-paragraph": "The Via Karelia runs east from Helsinki north to Salla in Lapland. The area has been inhabited since ancient times. Karelian tradesmen traveled north along this route.
