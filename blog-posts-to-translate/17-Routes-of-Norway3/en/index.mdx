## #1 Rallarvegen to Flåm 82 km (NSR 4)

Rallarvegen is part of [long distance cycling route #4](https://weonbikes.com/en/blog/cycling-routes-norway-1/#4-rallarvegen-500-km) (NSR 4) from Oslo to Bergen. The most popular stretch between Haugastøl and Flåm by the Aurlandsfjord is an 82 km gravel route on the old railway workers' route. It meanders at about 1000 m above sea level over the Hardangervidda plateau. The highest point is Fagernut at 1310 m.

![Hight Profile Rallarvegen from Haugastøl to Flåm](../img/Rallarvegen-hight-profile.jpg)

/>

The elevation profile is moderate up to Myrdal. The downhill route to Flåm, on the other hand, is very demanding. If you want to continue cycling towards Bergen on cycling route #4, you can take the train through the tunnel in Myrdal. For a detour to Flåm, you can use the world-famous railway line that winds through the mountain.

## #2 Mjølkevegen in Valdres 250 km (NSR 5)

From Gol (NSR #4, Rallarvegen) in Hallingdal, the route goes north to Bygdin. It starts in Golsfjellet in a hilly area with trails. Further north follows a pass (935 meters in altitude). On this section the route repeatedly meets the [Numedal route](https://weonbikes.com/en/blog/cycling-routes-norway-1/#5-numedal-route-950-km) (NSR #5). If you want to completely avoid road 51 from Beitostølen to Bygdin, you can cycle on the Numedal route and enjoy a 30 km long boat trip across Lake Bygdin.

From Bygdin it is worth taking a short hike up the Synshorn (1457 m) to enjoy the spectacular view over Jotunheimen.

![View over the peaks of Jotunheimen](../img/Jotunheimen.jpg)

In Bygdin the route turns north-east and leads to Vinstra (approx. 1000 m altitude) in Gulbrandsdalen. Goats, sheep and cows roam freely in the area. But you can still camp anywhere. You can [download a nice detailed map of Valdres here](https://www.valdres.com/dbimgs/Mj%C3%B8lkevegenbrosjyre_2020_framside_download.pdf).

  text="Download GPX/KML route Mjølkevegen"
/>

Vinstra has a train station. It is about 80 km from Lillehammer. There are several cabins on Mjølkevegen. The area is well developed and offers many different options, for example the gravel route from Lemonsjøen to Ruten through Murudalen as an alternative or complement to the start in Vinstra. Also in Ruten there is a cabin.

## #3 Telemark Canal 113 km (NSR 2)

The Telemark Canal was built between 1854 and 1892 to enable timber rafting and to contribute to the industrialization of Telemark Province. On 18 lock levels it overcomes a height difference of 75 meters.

![Hight profile Telemark Canal](../img/Telemarkkanal-hight-profile.jpg)

The cycle route from east to west between Ulefoss and Dalen follows the [national cycle route #2](https://weonbikes.com/en/blog/cycling-routes-norway-1/#2-canal-route-386-km), leads over roads with little traffic and gravel paths, and climbs around 2300 meters all together. Passing high lock walls and long lakes, you are quickly out of civilization and into surprisingly wild nature.

## #4 Dovre Loop 125 km (NSR 5)

South of Trondheim, about east of Ålesund, you'll find several national parks with lots of peaks: Trollheimen National Park north of [national cycling route #8](https://weonbikes.com/en/blog/cycling-routes-norway-2/#8-trollheimen-route-166-km) and Dovrefjell-Sundalsfjell National Park south of the route. Further south are the **Dovre National Park** and the Rondane National Park. The national cycle route #5 passes them to the west.

The Dovre Loop is a 125 km long, in parts newly created cycling route. Most of it follows gravel trails, some parts are on asphalt. Starting in Dombås you cycle on the new path to Hjerkinn, then follow the road to Folldal, Grimsdalen and Dovre and back to Dombås.

  text="Download GPX/KML Route 4-1 Dovre Loop"
/>

There are several ways to detour and explore the national park even further. The routes are marked on the Open Cycle Map. Alternatively you can cycle a route in the direction from the **mountains to the fjord**: Start in Hjerkinn, to Dombås, then north to Lesja and Bjorli and **parallel to cycle route #5** the **spectacular descent through the Romsdalen valley** to the fjord to Åndalsnes (155 km).

  text="Download GPX/KML Route 4-2 Dovre to Åndalsnes"
/>

There are all sorts of things to do on the Dovre loop: viewpoint on Snøhetta, spotting musk oxen (bring binoculars!), mining museum in Folldal or horseback riding instead of cycling. There is also a train line to Hjerkinn.

![musk oxen](../img/Moschusochsen.jpg)

The Numedal route, [national cycle route #5](https://weonbikes.com/en/blog/cycling-routes-norway-1/#5-numedal-route-950-km), connects the Dovre route with **Mjølkevegen**, see section #2, on a gravel route across the Valdresflye plateau to Beitostølen: Dombås - Lesja - Vågå - Beitostølen (165 km).

## #5 North Sea Coastal Route through Jæren 140 km (NSR 1)

The North Sea Coast Route is part of the national long-distance cycle route #1 and [EuroVelo 12](https://weonbikes.com/en/blog/3-european-seas-by-bike/#north-sea-cycle-route-7000-km-eurovelo-12).

A particularly beautiful part of this North Sea coastal route is the **Jærruta**, a 140 km long Norwegian scenic route from Eigersund via Hå and Klepp to Sola. The route section leads over cycle paths and very quiet roads, is flat and family-friendly.

**Jæren** is a coastal landscape in southwestern Norway in the province of Rogaland. The approximately 65 km long coastline is Norway's largest lowland area and is of agricultural importance. At the westernmost point, Jæren Reef stretches two nautical miles out into the North Sea. For centuries, the reef established Jæren's reputation as a ship graveyard among seafarers.

The coastal landscape of Jæren is unique in Norway: 70 km of long sandy and pebble beaches, narrow roads along steep cliffs, a lunar landscape in the south, and the Magma Geopark. And then the dramatic bike tunnel at Jøssingfjord with Norway's most unusual rest area, spectacular views and overnight accommodation. An authentic bike route with contrasts. Also locals use the route on a regular base.

![Jøssingfjord](../img/Jossingfjord.jpg)

A [travel guide of the North Sea Coastal Route in Norway](https://issuu.com/designstrek/docs/nvmagasin2022-23_eng) in English with detailed descriptions of the sights can be found in the free downloadable brochure from the Norwegian Tourist Association. This is the route (in bold is the **Jæren** scenic route): Kristiansand - Lindesnes - Farsund - Flekkefjord - Sokndal - **Eigersund - Hå - Klepp - Sola** \- Stavanger. The ensuing places Randaberg - Kvitsøy - Bokn - Karmøy - Utsira - Haugesund can only be reached in this order by longer ferry trips and island hopping. The reason are the many car tunnels. The new coastal route #1 runs further east via Årdal.

## #6 Helgeland Coastal Route ca. 500 km (NSR 1)

The Helgeland Coastal Route is part of the [national long-distance cycle route #1](https://weonbikes.com/en/blog/cycling-routes-norway-1/#1-coastal-route-4500-km) along the coast. Helgelandskysten is one of the Norwegian Tourist Routes. _Kystriksveien_ is the name of the 650 km long route, which begins a little further south in Steinkjer, but otherwise covers the same route. Besides the stunning views of the rugged cliffs of the Norwegian coast, it has many sights that you shouldn't miss along the way.

The Helgeland Coastal Route runs from Holm via Brønnøysund, Forvik, Sandnessjøen, Hellåga, Grønsvik, Braset, Storvika to Bodø (at least 6 ferries). With the **Nordland Travel Pass** for NOK 1290 (2022) you can travel for a week in Nordland by ferry, boat and bus. You can find out [more about the Nordland weekly ticket](https://www.reisnordland.com/travel-pass-nordland) here. That makes a few detours to interesting places that are not directly on the route easy.

![Bike path Torghatten](../img/Torghatten-Wegweiser.jpg)

**Torghatten** is a rock just south of Brønnøysund. From the seaside you can see that it has a huge hole in the middle: 35 m high and 160 m long. You can take a short hike to the mountain on the peninsula, stand in the opening and enjoy the view of the archipelago.

![View from Torghatten](../img/Torghatten.jpg)

**Why is the hole in Torghatten?** Lekamøya, an honorable maiden, was educating the seven wild daughters of the mighty troll king Sulitjelmakongen when she was spotted bathing by Hestmannen, the son of another troll king. To avoid being kidnapped, the seven sisters fled with Lekamøya. A wild midsummer chase across the islands began. Hestmannen shot an arrow. The king of the Sømna Mountains observed this and threw his hat in between. But then the sun came up and everyone involved petrified where they were. The hat with the hole became Torghatten on the island of Torgar. The seven sisters, who actually found Hestmannen quite attractive, sat down next to each other on the island of Alster to wait for him, and Lekamøya found shelter on the island of Leka.

![Hole in Torghatten](../img/Torghatten-Loch.jpg)

A little further north of Brønnøysund is **Forvik**, an old trading town. You can visit the cozy coffee roastery right on the quay and stock up on chocolate for your tour. Then continue across the island of Alster, where, on a short stretch of the coastal road, you can overlook the entire mountain range of the **Seven Sisters**.

**Island hopping**: The **Vega Archipelago**, with its interplay of eider ducks and island population, is considered a World Heritage area. On the island of Lovund you can admire **puffins** and on the island of Myken is the northernmost **whiskey** distillery. You could take the ferry from Lovund via Træna to Myken. Nice options if you only have a tour planned in this area.

![Puffins](../img/Papgaientaucher.jpg)

Between Jektvik and Kilboghamn you cross the **Arctic Circle**. At the Holandsfjord, a detour to the **Svartisen glacier** is worthwhile. And just a few kilometers south of Bodø is **Saltstraumen**, the world's strongest tidal current with many vortices over a length of 2.5 km.

## #7 Lavkaløypa in Lyngenfjord 68 km (NSR 10)

The [Lavkaløypa](https://www.visitnorway.com/listings/lavkal%C3%B8ypa/217111/) is a 68 km long gravel route on the Lyngenfjord, which stretches in a north-south direction at about the height of Tromsø. You'll pass it when you're on [National Long Distance Cycle Route #10](https://weonbikes.com/en/blog/cycling-routes-norway-2/#10-north-cape--lindesnes).

One of Northern Norway's most popular off-road cycling races, _Lavkarittet_, follows Lavkaløypa. The route is signposted, strenuous but technically not difficult at all. From south to north it starts in Hatteng, almost at the end of the fjord, following the Kitdal to the top. You ride 800 meters in altitude. Then the route continues over a plateau and through the Skibotndal downhill to Skibotn.

A detour from route #10 with spectacular views for trail fans, which is best done without luggage. From Skibotn back to Hatteng on the Nordlysveien (E6) along the fjord it is only 22 km.

## #8 Mjøstråkk around Lake Mjøsa 234 km (NSR 7)

Lake Mjøsa is Norway's largest lake. You'll pass it when cycling the [National Cycling Route #7](https://weonbikes.com/en/blog/cycling-routes-norway-2/#7-pilgrims-route-700-km), the Pilgrim's Trail. A 250 km long cycle route, the Mjøstråkk, goes around it.

![Lake Mjøsa](../img/Mjosa.jpg)

Three larger cities are on the route: Gjøvik, Hamar and Lillehammer. The route is signposted and follows gravel paths and asphalt roads. Technically, the route is easy, but there are some climbs:

Minnesund–Gjøvik 72 km – strenuous, Gjøvik–Lillehammer 48 km – rather strenuous, Lillehammer–Hamar 61 km – rather easy, Hamar–Minnesund 53 km – rather easy

On Mjøstråkk you cycle through towns and places and get to know Norway's culture and history. Whether it's an art museum, stave church, stone drawings, culinary delights or a boat trip, you'll find it on the banks of Lake Mjøsa. Check the [Mjøstråkk website](https://en.visit-innlandet.no/mjostrakk) for more details.

PS: Don't miss Norway's smallest chocolate factory in Gjøvik.

## #9 Suleskarvegen 135 km (NSR 2)

Suleskarvegen is the highest connecting road in southwestern Norway, stretching between Oslo and Stavanger. It starts in Suleskar in Sirdal, runs through Brokke in Setesdal, over the mountains to Dalen in Telemark and ends in Høydalsmo. A mountain road with splendid views for fans of climbing.

![Hight profile west-east Suleskarvegen](../img/Suleskarvegen-hight-profile.jpg)

Suleskarvegen is one of the Norwegian Scenic Routes and lies on national cycle route #2, the [Telemark route](https://weonbikes.com/en/blog/cycling-routes-norway-1/#2-canal-route-386-km). This route is also very popular with motorcyclists. Check out the [Sulekarvegen website](https://suleskarvegen.no/en/for-those-not-in-a-hurry/) for highlights not to be missed on this route.

## #10 Classic Fjord Route ca. 570 km (NSR 1)

The classic fjord route is a road bike route between Ålesund and Kristiansund featuring the highlights of Fjord Norway: the famous Atlantic Road, Trollstigen with its hairpin bends, the Geirangerfjord and above it Dalsnibber, the highest viewpoint over a fjord.

The route starts in Molde and ends in Ålesund. You can divide it into 5 stages:

1.  **Molde - Bud - Atlantic Road** to Kårvåg and Håholmen, approx. 100 km. The Atlantic Road is a road structure consisting of eight bridges over several small islands. Impressive.
2.  **Atlantic Road - Angvik**, about 100 km. The route follows road 666 along the beautiful Kvernesfjord. You overcome 1300 meters in altitude for the beautiful view.
3.  **Angvika - Eresfjord - Åndalsnes - Trollstigen - Valldal**, about 170 km. From Eresdal the route leads across the Vistalsheia plateau to Åndalsnes. Then up the Trollstigen.

![Trollstigen height profile](../img/hight-profile-Trollstigen.jpg)

5.  **Valldal - Geiranger - Dalsnibba - Geiranger**, about 75 km. By ferry to Eidsdal and then along UNESCO World Heritage fjord landscapes to touristic Geiranger. Then to the Dalsnibba viewing platform at 1400 m altitude with a breathtaking view over the Gairangerfjord. You overcome 2250 meters in altitude on this world-famous section of the route.

![Fjord view](../img/classic-fjord.jpg)

7.  **Geiranger – Ålesund**, about 120 km. First, take the ferry through the Gairangerfjord to Hellesylt. This is where the Queen's Route through Norangsdalen begins, a valley full of cultural monuments. It takes you to Urke at the Hjørundfjord, fringed by the sharp peaks of the Sunmøre Alps. From there you take the ferry to Ålesund.

## #11 Around Oslo Fjord 215 km (NSR 7)

Many routes lead around the Oslo fjord. On the east side runs the national cycle route #7, the [pilgrim route](https://weonbikes.com/en/blog/cycling-routes-norway-2/#7-pilgrims-route-700-km). Further south, the Coastal Route runs along both sides. The east side of the fjord is called Østfold, the west side Vestfold.

After a visit to Oslo, it is worth making a detour to Drøbak, Filtvet and the island of Hvitsten, to name just a few. The urban environment with lots of nature and bike paths is the right choice for everyone who is interested in culture, cuisine, country and people..

## #12 Andøya in Vesterålen 100 km (NSR 1)

North of the Lofoten lies Andøya with the fishing village Andenes. A road goes around the rocky island. Impressive views in the rough Norwegian Sea climate contrast with white sandy beaches and the midnight sun. The route is rather flat and uncomplicated. The road around Andøya is one of the Norwegian Scenic Routes.

## #13 Majestic Fjord Route 290 km (NSR 3)

The Majestic Fjord Route starts east of Bergen in Vossevangen, accessible by train from Bergen or Oslo. It partially coincides with the **Gaularfjellet** Scenic Route and runs on national long-distance cycle route #3, the [Fjords and Mountains route](https://weonbikes.com/en/blog/cycling-routes-norway-1/#3-fjord-and-mountain-route-1000-km). It turns west at Førde and runs along the Stongfjord to the coast, where it follows the Coastal Route #1 to Askvoll. Alternatively, you can take the ferry to Bergen from there.

Mykedalen, Vikjafjellet, the Gaularfjellet viewpoint, **Sunnfjord** and **Stongfjord** are the highlights of this road route. You can watch a [video of the Majestic Ford Route](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oh7xhg4ub4w) on Fjord Norway's YouTube channel.
